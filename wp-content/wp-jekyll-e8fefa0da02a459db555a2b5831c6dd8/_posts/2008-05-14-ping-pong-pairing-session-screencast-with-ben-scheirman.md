Well, it&#8217;s two-fer Tuesday here at Los Techies, I guess!&nbsp; By pure coincidence, Ben Scheirman wrapped up the post-production of a screencast we did a few weeks ago.

[Ben Scheirman](http://flux88.com/) just recently [posted on his blog](http://flux88.com/ScreencastTestDrivingAnInventoryScreen.aspx) about it.

Ben did a LOT of work trying to get the video and audio in sync and did a **_heroic_** job. We still have a lot to learn about how to get everything to work together (audio, video, shared Internet connection), so please forgive us on the unprofessional nature of the screencast. We&#8217;re developers messing around with screencasts, this isn&#8217;t our day job! :)

The Screencast can be viewed here:

Just like Ben did in his post, I&#8217;d like to establish a few caveats:

  * I&#8217;m not a TDD expert! I make no claims of canon here or that this is official TDD or BDD gospel. Please take with a grain of salt! 
      * Our main goal was to have a pairing session using TDD and record it. We started out trying to teach some TDD fundamentals, but it just turned into a cool jam session 
          * We had a lot of technological problems w/r/t Skype dropping calls. 
              * We had some time sync issues with the audio, so the audio and the video get out of sync part way through the video, but it&#8217;s still worth watching part of it 
                  * Sorry for the length, hopefully you can zip around and find stuff that&#8217;s interesting and then back up a little to see what you want to see.</ul> 
                Anyhow, there&#8217;s lots of good stuff in there, and I hope someone gets some useful into out of it. 
                
                I can&#8217;t speak for Ben, but I know I&#8217;d definitely like to keep trying this sort of thing in the future &#8212; hoping that the technological issues would work themselves out and Ben wouldn&#8217;t have to kill himself just to get the audio lined up!
