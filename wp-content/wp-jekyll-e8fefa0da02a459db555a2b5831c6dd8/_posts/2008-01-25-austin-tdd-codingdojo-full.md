We actually didn&#8217;t get the form shut down in time and a few overflow&#8217;s slipped in, so it&#8217;s gonna be a little cramped.&nbsp; I&#8217;m betting that a few people will be no-shows (stuff comes up, hey, what can you do, right?) so I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll work out alright in the end. [Ray Houston](http://www.rayhouston.com/blog) and I have come up with a dev scenario for the dojo that will actually contribute something to the world and help kids learn, how &#8217;bout that, huh?

Anyhow, if you&#8217;re still interested in coming and didn&#8217;t get a chance to sign up, drop one of us a line and let us know and maybe we can work something out. We&#8217;re sincerely hoping (actually, terrified) that this will go well and we&#8217;ll want to do it again. Or maybe someone else will step up and facilitate it the next time and that can be a trend, who knows?

Thank you everyone who&#8217;s helped us and helped get everything together and shared ideas, support and well-wishes. We look forward to having a great session and learning a lot about not just TDD, but coding styles and micro design as well.
