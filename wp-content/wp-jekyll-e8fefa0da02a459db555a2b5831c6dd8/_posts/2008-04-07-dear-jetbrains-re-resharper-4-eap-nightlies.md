Dear JetBrains,

Thank you for putting it all on the line and having the stones to do public nightly builds as part of your ReSharper 4.0 EAP.&nbsp; It takes a lot to hang it all out there like that and risk suffering public humiliation from some of the most demanding, cranky, and self-righteous customers there are, but you did it. 

Some of them are awesome, some of them suck, but you respond and things generally get better and we see the progress and we sympathize with you as humans trying to make software and tripping and stumbling as you go.

Here&#8217;s to you, Mr. Compile-and-Publish-Nightly-IDE-Extensions-builds. We salute you!

Take note, other commercial software vendors&#8230;

Sincerely,

No one of consequence
