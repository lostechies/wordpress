It’s been in the works for awhile, but as he just posted [last night](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/thatotherguy/archive/2008/09/21/hola-los-techies-and-thanks.aspx), Gregory Long has accepted an invitation to the Los Techies crew!&#160; He’s been running another blog for quite some time with some great material. We’re very excited to see what cool stuff he can contribute to the already (I hope you think) cool stuff we’ve got going on recently.

You can grab his RSS or Atom or catch his updates through the main LT feed if you’d like.
