In case you haven’t noticed, the VAN logo now appears in our “Friends of Pablo” section. VAN is really taking off!

If you have checked out VAN (Virtual ALT.NET) before, I suggest you run, not walk, to check it out now.

They’ve got a web site, a logo, and official INETA membership. The E-VAN (European VAN) is taking off as well.&#160; 

There are lots of great people working very hard on making this happen, so you should definitely give it a look!

The home page, which has everything you need to know is here:

<http://virtualaltnet.com/>

Also, they have a blog:&#160; <http://virualaltnet.blogspot.com/>

The next speaker is [Jean-Paul Sylvain Boodhoo](http://blog.jpboodhoo.com/) (on [Weds the 15th](http://virualaltnet.blogspot.com/2009/07/van-jean-paul-sylvain-boodhoo-in-town_12.html)).&#160; Be sure to check this out. JP always gives a good presentation.&#160;&#160; If you haven’t seen or heard him speak, you seriously owe it to yourself to try it this time. He’s inspirational, motivational, and just a great guy in general.
