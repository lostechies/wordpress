[J Sawyer](http://blog.microsoft-j.net), our local MS events guy, and Stephen Fulcher are hosting [a .NET coding dojo here in Austin, TX on November 3rd, 2008](http://blog.microsoft-j.net/2008/10/16/AustinrsquosFirstNetDojoWindowsCommunicationFoundation.aspx).

The topic is WCF and the format is based off a similar dojo event which was successful in Houston not too long ago.&#160; I suggest you check it out!

FYI, J posts about these sorts of events and cool stuff on [his blog](http://blog.microsoft-j.net), so you may want to check that out as well.
