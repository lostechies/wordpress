I’m generally not one for sentimentality, so it should come as no surprise to anyone that knows me that I allowed October to come and go without any ceremony.&#160; I figured, though, that I should give some dignity to the fact that I have been blogging for over a year now.&#160; 

First, I’d like to say that it was primarily the ALT.NET conference in October of 2007 that motivated me to blog and the rest was history. Though there are so many individuals to thank, a few particularly stand out as primary catalysts:&#160; Jeremy Miller, Scott Bellware, and David Laribee.&#160; Thank you everyone who has participated in the community and commented and encouraged me and I hope I have been able to contribute back in kind to your blogs and the community in general. 

Also, a very special thanks should go out to the folks at Los Techies who really helped me get going and hit a major stride in blogging. Not to mention providing an awesome atmosphere for exchanging, debating, and promoting ideas. 

To commemorate this otherwise uninteresting event, I’d like to post some stats for anyone who cares about those sorts of things :)

I don’t have exact figures on these, but from what I can tell from Feedburner, Community Server stats, Technorati, etc it appears that this is mostly correct:

I can’t seem to find a way to get Community Server to tell me this, so I’ll have to wing it, but I think this is mostly correct:
