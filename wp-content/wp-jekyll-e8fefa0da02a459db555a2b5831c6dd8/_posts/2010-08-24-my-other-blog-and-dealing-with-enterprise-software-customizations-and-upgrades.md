I have a few blog posts queued up that relate to the product I’m working on for my day job.&#160; The blog posts are generally product-specific and so (I feel) aren’t appropriate for posting on this (my Los Techies) blog as it would be crass marketing.&#160; I think that you, dear reader, did not subscribe to this feed to be marketed to, so I won’t offend you like that.&#160; If, for whatever reason, you’re interested in what I’m working on, or what my company is working on, you can check out [my employee blog](http://blogs.dovetailsoftware.com/blogs/cmyers/default.aspx), or [all the Dovetail blogs](http://blogs.dovetailsoftware.com/blogs/).

Having said all that, I just posted a recent post that I thought contained a lot of non-product-specific topics that might benefit you when thinking about problems of customizations, upgrades, frameworks, etc.&#160; So if you can overlook a few mentions of my product, I think the rest of the blog post may be beneficial to you. You can read it here:&#160; [Upgrade-Safe Customizations](http://blogs.dovetailsoftware.com/blogs/cmyers/archive/2010/08/23/upgrade-safe-customizations.aspx).&#160; Please let me know if you disagree with my assessment.
