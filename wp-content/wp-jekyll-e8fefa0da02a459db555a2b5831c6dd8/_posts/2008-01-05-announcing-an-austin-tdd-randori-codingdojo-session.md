[Ray Houston](www.rayhouston.com/blog) and I will be hosting/facilitating a [CodingDojo](http://wiki.agilefinland.com/?CodingDojo)-style, [Randori](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randori)-style TDD session in early February here in Austin, TX.

(EDIT: Shoot, I forgot to mention that this idea came from [David Laribee](http://codebetter.com/blogs/david_laribee/) and Scott Bellware (no linkage currently available). I&#8217;d like to thank them for their ideas and encouragement)

We have several venues we&#8217;re currently working out the details with and we&#8217;ll post more info when we&#8217;ve finalized the location.

It will likely be Saturday February 2 or Saturday February 9, 2008.

Our plan is this:

  * Half-day, compressed session (though if there&#8217;s enough interest, we may go full-day, but that remains to be seen) 
      * Building a very simple application focused on accomplishing a few user stories (NOT getting bogged down in the finer points of doing WinForms or WebForms development, we may use ASP.NET MVC, but I&#8217;d like to avoid muddying the waters with too much new technology all at once and distracting from the main focus: TDD) 
          * Several micro-iterations of design and coding 
              * We thinking about having a few more than the recommended 15 folks (like 25-30), but limiting the coding time of people stepping up to code so that you don&#8217;t get code hogs 
                  * Rather than a hard-and-fast 5 minute switch time, I was thinking more of a fishbowl/hot-seat style where, if you think you can do better, you hold up a card and take over, but you can only do it once every iteration so that you don&#8217;t get code hogs</ul> 
                We&#8217;re still shaking out all the details and we&#8217;re open to suggestions/criticisms, etc.
