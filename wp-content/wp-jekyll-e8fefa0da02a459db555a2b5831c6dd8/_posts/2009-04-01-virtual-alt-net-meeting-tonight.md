Zachariah Young has been rockin’ the Virtual ALT.NET (VAN) meetings for the past several months. There’s been good turnout and good discussions.&#160; He’s kicking it up a notch and asking members of the community to present something interesting at each meeting.

This week, Zachariah has asked Yegor Yarko to speak.&#160; He joined us in last week&#8217;s call and was very helpful in answering questions.&#160; He will be doing a demo of Team City and also showing us other scenarios using Team City. 

Also if you have any other topics or questions about Team City, Yegor has asked that you submit them to the VAN Google group: <http://groups.google.com/group/virtualaltnet>

VAN’s are Microsoft LiveMeeting events. The details are below:

Start Time: Wednesday,&#160; April 1, 2009 9:00 PM GMT -5 (CDT)   
End Time: Wednesday,&#160; April 1, 2009 12:00 PM GMT -5 (CdT)
