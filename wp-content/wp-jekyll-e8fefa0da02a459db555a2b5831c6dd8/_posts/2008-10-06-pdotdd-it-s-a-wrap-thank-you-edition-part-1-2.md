On Saturday, we concluded our Pablo’s Days of TDD event here in sunny Austin, TX.&#160; Over all, I think it went really well. All the feedback I personally heard was positive and we asked people to fill out evaluation forms and, from what I saw, they all had good things to say and lots of good suggestions for making the next one (if we can ever manage it) even better.

Thank you everyone who attended. You made it worth doing and I hope you got a lot out of it and are able to take something back to your regular day-to-day routine and make it a little better somehow.

Just a reminder for everyone, all the materials are online [at our Google Code project](http://code.google.com/p/daysoftdd/). You currently need Subversion to grab it. We’ll work this week on getting a ZIP’d up version of the repository so you can just download it without needing to install an SVN client.

In Part 2 of this post, I’ll recount what went down and talk about going forward. For right now, I want to get sentimental and drop a few thanks on some people:

I’d like to call out the sponsors and individuals who stepped up to make this thing happen.

## Special Individuals (in no particular order with a chronological bias, perhaps)

I know I’m going to miss a few people here, so let me just first say “I’m sorry, I’m a heel” preemptively.&#160; Thank you to:

  * the families and significant others of the organizers who had to put up with the late nights, stress, and being gone Friday night and all day Saturday!
  * Gregory Long – for kicking us in the butt to get this thing going again. He’s now a Los Techies, but he was pushing us long before that.&#160; He helped get things moving again and we would like to specially thank you.
  * Ray Houston – he’s a Los Techie, but he really stepped up near the end and worked long hours working on source code, lab materials, printing and binding the lab books, not to mention everything he did the day-of.&#160; Also, I’m told his wife drove across town to help bind the booklets! Thank you!
  * Eric Hexter and …
  * Joe Ocampo and …
  * John Teague – All three of you: for working late nights and helping to get the lab materials done, calling sponsors, helping to arrange everything, leading labs the day-of,

  * Scott Bellware – for donating an MSDN Premium subscription (yes, the full subscription deal! wow!) and helping out at the end with one of the sessions I was leading
  * Jimmy Bogard, Joshua Flanagan, Jason Meridth and the entire Los Techies crew who pitched in here and there before and during the event and generally made the whole process go easier
