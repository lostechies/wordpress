I’m in the process of writing an upcoming article for [CoDe Magazine](http://www.code-magazine.com/) about getting started with NHibernate.

I’ve spoken with several people about my approach and the majority of them seem to agree that I should use Fluent NHibernate for the mappings instead of the HBM XML.&#160; Of course, I will mention the HBM XML since Fluent NHibernate isn’t a complete solution (yet) for mappings, but for the day-to-day stuff, Fluent NHibernate is like buttah and will, I think, ease the learning process.

Unfortunately, at this time, Fluent NHibernate doesn’t have any sort of binary release (even a 0.1 release).&#160; So this means I’ll have to tell the readers to use SVN to pull the trunk and do a build.&#160; My instincts tell me that this is too much to ask and too heavy a burden for a “getting started” article.

Thus, a conundrum.&#160; The best answer would be for me to do a build and place the binaries online somewhere for them to download.&#160; Of course there are problems with this approach as well licensing issues perhaps, bandwidth, etc.&#160; Perhaps I could get the FNH folks to cut a 0.1 binary release? \*poke poke\*&#160; Barring that, what recourse do I have left?

I need the wisdom of the inter-clouds here to assist me in my dilemma. What say you?
