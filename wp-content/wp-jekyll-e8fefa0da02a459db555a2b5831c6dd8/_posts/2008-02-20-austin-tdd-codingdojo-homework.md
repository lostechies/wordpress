A few folks have been working on some of the stories and code we were talking about at the Austin TDD CodingDojo earlier this month.&nbsp; [Joe Ocampo](http://agilejoe.lostechies.com), [Ray Houston](http://rhouston.lostechies.com), and I have been discussing it and Joe even did a cool spike/prototype to get things moving (I&#8217;ve looked at it Joe, I haven&#8217;t had a chance to write back my thoughts or merge the code in yet, sorry man).

[Gregory Long](http://penmanscratch.blogspot.com/) was another attendee and he recently [posted on his blog](http://penmanscratch.blogspot.com/2008/02/austin-tdd-dojo-homework-part-1-intro.html) and worked out some of the model as some minimal up-front design to kick off the testing and implementation.

Has anyone else done anything else with the code yet? Let me know in case I&#8217;ve missed it. I was thinking of doing a spike myself and comparing notes with everyone.
