**Who we’re looking for** || Dovetail Software is staffing a new team for an innovative software project. We’re looking for junior- to mid-level software developers with demonstrable C# (preferably .NET 2.0 or later) and HTML/CSS experience (not necessarily ASP.NET, just web development in general). Any experience with test-driven development or automated unit testing in general is a huge plus.&#160; Also, participation in the community (attendance of events, avid blog reader + commenter, or maybe you even have a blog yourself) will put you firmly in the running for this position. We’re looking for people that believe learning and continuous improvement are primary responsibilities of a software developer. We’re hiring motivated people for a terrific opportunity with a team of recognized .NET and agile community leaders.

**Our development methodology** || We are an Agile shop (Scrum/XP). We work in short iterations, not long crushing release cycles. We have a collaborative relationship with our customers. We write tests before we write functional code to clarify our design intentions. We keep the build clean. We work in an environment that maximizes communication to minimize the volume of spec documents. We build software that can effectively respond to change. We use open source tools where appropriate, and Microsoft tools where they make sense. We have executive support and visibility all the way up to the owner of the company. 

**About Dovetail Software** || Serving companies since 1995, Dovetail Software develops CRM products for global 1000 enterprises. Our product, Dovetail CRM, is a comprehensive customer service and support, logistics management, customer self service, and knowledge management suite. Dovetail is a small company with big customers and great benefits for its employees. Our outstanding compensation package includes company-assisted health, dental, and life insurance, matching 401k, and more. 

**About Austin** || Placing second in the Large Cities Creativity Ranking, Austin is recognized as a city with a thriving music scene, ethnic and cultural diversity, endless outdoor recreations, and a great nightlife. It’s a nationally recognized center for technology innovation—home to 3,200 tech companies with 98,000 employees.
