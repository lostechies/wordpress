Dovetail Software is hiring developers to work on our HR Case Management SaaS app. We’re looking for smart people to help us work on some cool stuff on cutting edge technology hosted in AWS. Help us write some code, automate some servers and push updates to happy customers!

While we still have some .NET code, we&#8217;re also doing quite a lot of other stuff now. We&#8217;ve got a little bit for everyone (from Javascript stuff like node, require, knockout to systems management and automation using AWS, Ruby, Python, Puppet, etc).

We’re currently looking for:

  * [Developers and Senior Developers](http://dovetailsoftware.com/hr/cmyers/2014/01/13/dovetail-hiring-developers/)
  * [DevOps Engineers](http://dovetailsoftware.com/hr/cmyers/2014/01/13/dovetail-hiring-devops-engineers/)
