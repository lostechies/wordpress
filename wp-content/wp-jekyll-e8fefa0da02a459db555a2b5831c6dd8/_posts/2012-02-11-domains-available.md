In my effort to make myself an ex-GoDaddy customer, I have 3 domains left to transfer or let expire.

Two of them I&#8217;m making available to transfer to anyone who wants them (rather than letting them expire so that you would have to pay the recovery fee).

Anyone want these domain names before I let them expire?

whackcoder.net

startingwith.net

Both are currently parked and have no viewership to speak of.
