It&#8217;s been a couple of busy weeks! The weekend before my presentations in Arkansas, I decided to forego sleep and go to [Wakarusa](http://www.wakarusa.com/)! The Saturday lineup included two of my favorite electronica acts, [Shpongle](http://www.twistedmusic.com/artists/shpongle) and [Ott](http://www.ottsonic.com/), and introduced to another band STS9. Staying up all night dancing to heavy techno music and getting no sleep was one heck of a prelude to the week. After the seriously fun times I stopped in on the Fort Smith and Northwest Arkansas .NET user groups and shared my thoughts on Event Driven Architecture. Both nights went well, with some great conversations afterwards about the how and why that took me towards that style of architectural system design.

Tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM (hey, if you aren&#8217;t first, you&#8217;re last &#8212; this is Texas after all) I&#8217;ll be presenting at Dallas TechFest on the same subject in the .NET track. If you want to learn more about Event Driven Architecture and how we are making it easier to implement with MassTransit, come by and check it out. I promise to deliver a demo that includes all sorts of cool things like NHibernate, FluentNHibernate, StructureMap, Castle, Topshelf, Magnum, and of course, MassTransit.

Also, if you&#8217;re in the Tulsa area and weren&#8217;t able to make it to Dallas TechFest, I&#8217;ll be presenting at the Tulsa .NET User Group on the 29th of June as well. If you do come by, be sure to stop afterwards and say hello. I&#8217;ll be at the event throughout the day and am more than happy to talk to anyone interested in learning more about [MassTransit](http://code.google.com/p/masstransit/). I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be around the functional programming open space playing with crazy monadic parsers written in C#.
