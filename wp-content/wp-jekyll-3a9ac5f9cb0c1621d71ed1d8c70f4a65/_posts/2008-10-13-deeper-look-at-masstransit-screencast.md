If you haven&#8217;t watched [the video from the presentation](http://www.viddler.com/explore/PhatBoyG/videos/2/) Dru and I did on Thursday at Tulsa TechFest, I recommend you watch it if you are interested in MassTransit and seeing how it works. Once you have watched it, check out the new screencast I just produced that goes deeper into the code to show how MassTransit makes it all work. You can [download the video](http://blog.phatboyg.com/wp-content/MassTransitTTFScreencast.mov) (be sure to Save As for those repeated late-night viewings).

In the video, I go into the source code of the demo that was shown in the presentation. Mind you, I think this is my first screencast, so I&#8217;m probably just talking to myself way to much but that helps me think.

Enjoy!
