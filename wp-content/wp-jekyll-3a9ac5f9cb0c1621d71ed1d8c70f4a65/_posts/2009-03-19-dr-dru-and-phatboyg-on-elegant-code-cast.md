Just over a week ago, [Dru Sellers](http://drusellers.codebetter.com/) and I recorded a podcast with [Elegant Code](http://elegantcode.com/)rs [Jarod Ferguson](http://elegantcode.com/about/jarod-ferguson/) and [David Starr](http://elegantcode.com/about/david-starr/). We spent a couple of hours discussing [event driven architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_Driven_Architecture) (EDA), messaging, and [MassTransit](http://code.google.com/p/masstransit/). Through the magic of editing, they managed to end up with a solid eighty minutes (most likely to achieve a straight up [G](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=G) rating). 

[Check it out on their web site](http://elegantcode.com/2009/03/18/code-cast-25-masstransit/) (where you can listen, or subscribe via iTunes/PodCastRSS).
