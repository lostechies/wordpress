It looks like VMware has dropped a public beta of VMware Fusion 2.0 to the public. There are too many new features in this release to mention, so I will just share the link:

<http://communities.vmware.com/community/beta/fusion>

Be sure to check the release notes to see if they impact your work before upgrading to this beta release.

Items of interest I took away from the release notes:

  * Use Fn+M to simulate the non-existent insert key in Windows (hello R#) 
  * Multiple display support for virtual machines (hello second monitor) 
  * Improved compatibility with Visual Studio (not sure what this is yet) 

Be sure to check it out!
