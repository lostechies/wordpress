  <h3>
    Event Driven Architecture
  </h3>
</div>

Business applications no longer exist as isolated systems. In order to provide integrated solutions that add business value, applications must be connected. Modern approaches for enterprise application integration (EAI) such as Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) separate applications into services that can be accessed via a standard interface such as a web service. This collection of services provides a platform on which new applications can be created that leverage the existing functionality. 

However, as application complexity increases, the coupling of services becomes an impediment in adapting applications to meet the ever-changing goals of the business. Event Driven Architecture (EDA) is a method of designing and implementing systems where events are exchanged between highly decoupled components and services. EDA does not replace SOA, instead it compliments the request/response nature of SOA with a highly scalable event model for building and coordinating asynchronous transactions. 

In this presentation, I will explain event driven architecture, describe the different types of events, demonstrate how events can be related and orchestrated, and provide a basic understanding of how this method can drive the architecture of enterprise systems. In addition to understanding the concepts of event driven architecture, we will explore a working sample built using an open-source .NET messaging framework called MassTransit. 

You can catch this presentation at the following events:

  * On Monday, June 8th, I&#8217;ll be presenting at the [Fort Smith .NET User Group](http://www.fsdnug.org/).
  * On Tuesday, June 9th, I&#8217;ll be presenting at the [Northwest Arkansas .NET User Group](http://nwadnug.org/tabid/54/ModuleID/370/ItemID/42/mctl/EventDetails/Default.aspx).
  * On Friday, June 19th, I&#8217;ll be presenting at [Dallas TechFest 2009](http://www.dallastechfest.com/).
