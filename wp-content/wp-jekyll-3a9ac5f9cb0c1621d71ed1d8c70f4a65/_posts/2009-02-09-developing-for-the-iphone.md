First, one my the reasons I love using OSX: 16 applications open including 4 Xcode projects, Photoshop, Numbers, Evernote, Mindjet MindManager, and more without a hint of slowdown and still 1.3 GB free (4GB total on my MBP). It&#8217;s wide, because I use a 24&#8243; display next to my built-in laptop display.

I&#8217;ve been doing a lot of work in Xcode lately, building an application for the iPhone. I officially joined the developer program this past weekend, making it possible to load applications into my phone for testing. I&#8217;ve got a few ideas for some applications that I haven&#8217;t seen done yet, so hopefully I can get something out there to fill the void.

I have to say, the more I work in Objective-C, the more I like it. Sure, I&#8217;m missing a few things like all my comfortable frameworks and such, but there are plenty of other ways to deal with things I&#8217;ve coming across. And since the NDA, sites like [Stack Overflow](http://www.stackoverflow.com/) have become a great resource for getting answers to issues I come across.

I&#8217;m still working on my other projects like MassTransit, this is just something to broaden my knowledge and have fun at the same time. Between developing on the iPhone, doing Java projects at work, and building open-source .NET frameworks at home &#8212; I&#8217;ve got plenty to keep me busy!
