In two weeks, the 2008 installment of [Tulsa TechFest](http://techfests.com/Tulsa/2008/default.aspx) will be upon us. For two days, Tulsa is going to unleash an impressive [array of sessions](http://techfests.com/Tulsa/2008/Agenda/default.aspx) on all aspects of IT, security, and software development. As I review the broad list of presenters I can&#8217;t help but see conflicting sessions where I&#8217;m going to have to make some tough choices.

If you are going to be anywhere near the Tulsa area and can manage to slip away from work for a couple of days I highly recommend making an appearance. The breadth of learning opportunities at the unbelievable price ($2/day) make this an incredible way to learn some new skills and sharpen your existing ones.

I will be presenting in two sessions this year. The first session will be on building distributed application using MassTransit (co-hosted by Dru Sellers) and other open-source frameworks for .NET. This is doing to be a deep view on how to build loosely-coupled systems on top of a messaging service (in this case, MSMQ). Advanced topics include asynchronous messaging and sagas (long-lived transactions).

The second session will be an **_introduction_** to iPhone development. I&#8217;m not a seasoned expert here, but I&#8217;m impressed with the platform provided by Apple (Xcode) free of charge for building applications for Mac OS X and the iPhone. This introduction will cover the tools and application structure for building iPhone applications in Objective-C.

If you happen to see me there, feel free to stop me and say hello.
