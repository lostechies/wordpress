Opening my Inbox this morning resulted in a pleasant surprise from Microsoft. I have been presented with the 2009 Microsoft&reg; MVP Award as a recognition for sharing my expertise in Visual C# with others. It is an honor to be recognized by Microsoft for doing something that I truly enjoy &#8211; building really cool software.

    A community-based award like this would not be possible without the support of my peers, and I look forward to meeting up with some of those very peers at the next MVP Summit! In the meantime, congratulations to all the new and renewed MVPs!
