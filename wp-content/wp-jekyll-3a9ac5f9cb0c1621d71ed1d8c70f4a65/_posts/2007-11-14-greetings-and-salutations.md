I just wanted to give a shout out to the guys at Los Techies for inviting me to join the site. I&#8217;m just now getting things up and running (and testing [MarsEdit](http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/) with Community Server with this post) so I can easily post content to the site.

I met many of the Los Techies guys in Austin at ALT.NET and I&#8217;m sure several beers were consumed with a majority of them. It was a great experience and I&#8217;m excited to see the attention grow around the movement.

Personally, I&#8217;ve been in software development for nearly 20 years, but I&#8217;m new to agile development practices such as XP/Scrum. I&#8217;ve recently started an initiative to adapt agile development at work so I&#8217;ll certainly write about those experiences as they unfold.

In the meantime, &#8220;Tengo un gato grande en mis pantalones!&#8221;
