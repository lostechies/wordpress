I got <a href="http://www.codesqueeze.com/what-music-do-you-code-to/" target="_blank">tagged</a> by Max Pool of <a href="http://www.codesqueeze.com/" target="_blank">{codesqueeze}</a> regarding my choice of tunes while coding. 

For me, it&#8217;s all about down tempo beats and no lyrics. And it started on <a href="http://www.di.fm/" target="_blank">DI.fm</a> in the <a href="http://www.di.fm/chillout/" target="_blank">Chillout Channel</a>. 

I was listening to a mix that just really got the juices flowing called Ott Times. It was mixed by <a href="http://www.psyshop.com/shop/World/" target="_blank">Morlack</a>. The song lead me on a quest to find the artists in the mix, which included: 

  * Shpongle
  * Ott
  * Younger Brother
  * Entheogenic
  * Shulman
  * Hallucinogen

Since then, I&#8217;ve managed to acquire almost every physical CD of each of these artists. I&#8217;ve put together a few of my favorite playlists that I enjoy while coding, chilling, or doing whatever. So that&#8217;s my flavor, one that&#8217;s worked for a while. I&#8217;ve since added some new artists to the roster, including Phutureprimitive and a few others. It&#8217;s amazing what you can find just lying in bed searching through the iTunes music store on your iPhone.
