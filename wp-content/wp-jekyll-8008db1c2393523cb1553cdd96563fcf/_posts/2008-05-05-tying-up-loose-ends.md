# Blogging Stuff

Just in case anyone was following/caring, I had started a few multi-part series posts that kind of fizzled out and I felt I owed the 3 of you who cared an explanation:

  * Agile Arguments: No one seemed to pick up or care about this one. I have a two half-written parts to this, but I&#8217;m not going to flog myself to finish them if there&#8217;s no interest.
  * Pablo&#8217;s Topic of the Month for April: Design Patterns &#8211; no one else chimed in on this one. April was rough for a lot of people and we just didn&#8217;t get it done. Sorry folks :(&nbsp; We&#8217;re human. We may try something for May, or pick it up again in June with a new topic (hopefully something that requires a little less investment so we can get back up to speed)

I think I might back away from heady posts altogether and get back to more code/task-oriented posts. There&#8217;s a ton of stuff out there and I&#8217;d like to start doing some real-world minutiae stuff with some test-driven design, IoC, or other stuff I preach sneakily thrown in there in the hopes that that might be a more effective strategy for getting people excited about some of these accelerators I have found.

# Community Stuff

## CodingDojo

The next incarnation of the TDD CodingDojo was planned for April, but my job situation + ALT.NET Seattle threw a wrench in that. May turned out to be for similar reasons. So the current plan is some time in June (hopefully early). We&#8217;ll see. Several of you have offered to help set up something and we (and I think I can speak for the Los Techies crew here) really appreciate the offer and we&#8217;ll probably be calling on you sometime soon.

## Screencasts

I recorded a screencast with [Ben Scheirman](http://www.flux88.com/) a few weekends ago and it worked out pretty well, I thought. Unfortunately there was some temporal distortion between our two audio streams, and last I checked he was slogging it out doing some grunt work to get it straightened out (thanks Ben!)&nbsp; If anyone knows why one audio stream slowly gets out of sync with the other (i.e. about 1 second every few minutes), we&#8217;d appreciate some help.

[Ray Houston](rhouston.lostechies.com) and [Jimmy Bogard](jimmybogard.lostechies.com) just recorded a screencast and it&#8217;s coming together nicely in post-production. Look for one of them (hopefully) to post about this soon (great job guys!)

I&#8217;d encourage all four of you who read my blog to consider doing a screencast.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a lot easier to do it in person, so if you&#8217;re in Austin maybe we could set something up together?

## DotNetSlackers and other sites

The crew over at [DotNetSlackers.com](www.dotnetslackers.com) are doing some pretty cool things and they&#8217;re asking for folks to help write articles, send in snippets, etc. I going to \*try\* to do some of these in the near future (I keep promising Sonu, but never following up &#8212; sorry man).

I&#8217;d like to suggest anyone who has even simple snippets or interesting ASP.NET MVC usage examples, or maybe even NHibernate 101 stuff, contributing it to DotNetSlackers to further the art. They&#8217;re clamoring for high quality content and they&#8217;re even willing to [**_PAY_**](http://dotnetslackers.com/articles/SubmissionGuidelines.aspx) for content! Yes, that&#8217;s right, pay! :) It&#8217;s in your professional as well as personal interests to contribute to a site like this (disclaimer: I have no affiliation with this site other than being an occasional forum poster and I received no money or other compensation to say any of this &#8212; I just like the site).
