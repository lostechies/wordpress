In case you haven’t seen John’s [posts about Pablo’s Fiesta](http://lostechies.com/johnteague/2011/06/24/its-all-about-the-conversation/),&nbsp; I suggest you check them out.

That’s right, Los Techies is having the 2nd annual “Pablo’s Fiesta” open spaces conference in Austin, TX over the weekend September 30, October 1 & 2.&nbsp; Most of the Austin peeps will be there and a host of folks from out of town.&nbsp; 

It’s an open spaces conference which means \*you\* get to choose the topics!&nbsp; There’ll be lots of folks ready to present on topics, plus there will be lots of open discussion topics (for example, John hosted a session on NoSQL so that he could learn and it turned out to be a really great session).&nbsp; Is there something you’ve been wanting to learn about and want to hear the unvarnished truth from folks in the trenches? Propose a session and, most likely, people will show up.

I’m looking to “facilitate” (that is, start a conversation, not necessarily present anything) a session on documentation topics.&nbsp; We’re thinking about changing how we do docs at Dovetail. [Dru Sellers](http://codebetter.com/drusellers/) brought this up to me and I’ve been eyeing, covetously, the [work that the django folks are doing](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.3/).&nbsp; I like their [style and philosophy](http://www.slideshare.net/jacobian/writing-great-documentation-codeconf-2011) of documentation.&nbsp; In fact, we’re even [considering it for FubuMVC’s docs](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/fubumvc-devel/8JkvWYl0u3o/OPNK8u5iBe0J).

I’d also like to get a bunch of the FubuMVC contributors and various other interested folks to talk about the future of FubuMVC and try to ramp up development, documentation, guides, etc.&nbsp; FubuMVC seems to be reaching a critical mass and I want the community to be well prepared for a boom so that it will be successful.

But that’s just what **_I_** want. The real question is, [what do **_YOU_** want](http://lostechies.github.com/fiesta/)?
