## You should go to Austin CodeCamp ‘09.

That’s a pretty sensationalistic title, I’ll give you that. I’m very serious though, [Austin CodeCamp ‘09](http://www.adnug.org/AustinCodeCamp09/) may actually prove to be better than bacon and even &#8212; yes, I’m going all the way here – cookie dough ice cream!&#160; LosTechies’ very own [Eric Hexter](http://hex.lostechies.com/)**** and [John Teague](http://johnteague.lostechies.com/) have put in some late nights getting this shindig together (and possibly other people – leave a comment please if you were involved, don’t be shy!) and they’ve done a bang-up job.

## LosTechies will be there in force

The Fraternity of the Donkey (or, in the future, the Universal Order of the Donkey should we ever manage to convince a blogger of the female variety to post here) had the idea that many of us would pitch in and do a bunch of CodeCamp sessions.

Many of us love the Central Texas region (specifically Austin and San Antonio) and we love [ADNUG](http://www.adnug.org/) and [Austin CodeCamp](http://www.adnug.org/AustinCodeCamp09/). We wish to see these things continue in the future, so we’re going to present as much as we can.&#160; 

You can see here that there is quite [an illustrious list of available sessions](http://www.adnug.org/AustinCodeCamp09/Proposal/List).&#160; Eric Hexter has posted [the results of the voting](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/hex/archive/2009/05/16/austin-code-camp-sessions-voting-results.aspx) and it looks like we’re going to have really good turnout.
