# Dovetail Hiring Senior Software Tester or Test Engineer

Work for one of the most progressive software development shops in the US. We’re building a new software product line using pioneering practices and technologies, such as:

  * WatiN 
  * Selenium 
  * StoryTeller (acceptance testing framework) 
  * Test-driven development 
  * Continuous integration

**Who we’re looking for** Dovetail Software is staffing a new team for an innovative software project. We’re looking for someone who can help us achieve the most usable, highest quality software product. We&#8217;re looking for people who can empathize with the user, question whether functionality actually makes sense. We&#8217;re looking for people who can flush out defects, inconsistencies, and mistakes in the software. This person should also be thinking about how to automate as much as possible to constantly increase test coverage and enforce quality throughout the development process.

Participation in the community (attendance of events, avid blog reader + commenter, or maybe you even have a blog yourself) will put you firmly in the running for this position. We’re looking for people that believe learning and continuous improvement are primary responsibilities of a tester. We’re hiring motivated people for a terrific opportunity with a team of recognized software development and agile community leaders.

**Our development methodology** We are an Agile/XP shop. We work in a continuously-improving pipeline mode, not iterations or long crushing release cycles. We have a collaborative relationship with our customers. We place an emphasis on usability and how people interact with our software. We write tests before we write functional code to clarify our design intentions. We automate whatever we can. We keep the build clean. We work in an environment that maximizes communication to minimize the volume of spec documents. We build software that can effectively respond to change. We use open source tools where appropriate, and Microsoft tools where they make sense. We have executive support and visibility all the way up to the owner of the company.

**About Dovetail Software** Serving companies since 1995, Dovetail Software develops CRM products for global 1000 enterprises. Our product, Dovetail CRM, is a comprehensive customer service and support, logistics management, customer self service, and knowledge management suite. Dovetail is a small company with big customers and great benefits for its employees. Our outstanding compensation package includes company-assisted health, dental, and life insurance, matching 401k, and more.
