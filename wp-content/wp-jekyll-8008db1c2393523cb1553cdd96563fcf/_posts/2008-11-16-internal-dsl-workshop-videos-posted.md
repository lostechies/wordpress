On October 31, 2008 I gave a workshop on building Internal DSLs in C# for [KaizenConf](http://www.kaizenconf.com/).&#160; Fellow Los Techian [John Teague](http://www.viddler.com/explore/Wbinford/videos/2/) was kind enough to record them and fellow Austinite Weston Binford rendered them and posted them up on Viddler. Thanks!

You can watch the videos here:

Part 2:

FYI, unfortunately the camera battery died at the end and missed the actual “building” part. Basically I went through the “Fairy Tale Builder” example. You can see the code in the code dump linked below.

The Slide deck and source code is available via our Google Code project:

I’d love to hear your comments and feedback.
