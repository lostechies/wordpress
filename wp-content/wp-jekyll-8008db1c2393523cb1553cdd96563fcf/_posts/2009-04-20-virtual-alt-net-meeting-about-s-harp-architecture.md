The VAN is still going strong, thanks to [Zachariah Young](http://www.zachariahyoung.com/zy/post/2009/04/19/A-Kick-Butt-evening-of-Sharp-Architecture-with-the-one-and-only-Billy-McCafferty-at-the-Helm.aspx) for all his dedication and hard work! We’re looking for feedback on the format and topics. Please opine on the [Virtual ALT.NET Mailing List](http://groups.google.com/group/virtualaltnet/) (they’re up to 286 members now!).

This week there’ll be a speaker:&#160; Billy McCafferty on S#harp Architecture.&#160; Zach asked if I could post a little something about the upcoming meeting and I’m happy to oblige:

> Speaker Bio for this week. Who is and what makes this Billy McCafferty guy tick?   
> Well he is a long time developer and a hopeless romantic when it comes   
> to writing beautiful software. Billy currently leads a double life   
> between helping to run a small training and consulting company known   
> as Codai (which will be getting a new website very very soon) and   
> filling the role of lead developer and architect with Parsons   
> Brinckerhoff. After Billy gets his life back – which should be after   
> the release of S#arp Architecture 1.0 – expect to see him soon at   
> [ALT.NET](http://ALT.NET) and other development conferences. 

> He will be demonstrating the latest cut of S#harp Architecture 1.0   
> with a 45-50 minute non-PPT presentation. 
> 
> Bring your opinions and attention. Questions and Answer will be served   
> also. The drinks as usual are up to the participants. 
> 
> Should be a fun evening. See you all there. 
> 
> Meeting details.
