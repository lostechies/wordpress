The [altnetpodcast](http://www.altnetpodcast.com/) crew released the [second part of the discussion](http://www.altnetpodcast.com/episodes/2-alt.net-and-microsoft) that [Mike Moore](http://www.blowmage.com/), [Jeremy Miller](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/default.aspx), [David Laribee](http://codebetter.com/blogs/david_laribee/), and I had about ALT.NET, continuous improvement, and the relationship between Microsoft and the .NET community at large.
