### A Little Background

UPDATE: 2012 &#8211; Fix links which have changed or expired

I have been relatively quiet about FubuMVC for some time (only briefly mentioning it in passing on this blog).  It has been a project that has been fermenting for some time with a slow start.  Now it is picking up pace and really coming to fruition due in no small part to [Jeremy Miller](http://jeremymiller.codebetter.com/)’s recent efforts not to mention [Mark Nijhof](http://elegantcode.com/about/mark-nijhof/) , [Ryan Kelley](http://www.techfocus2.com/), [Josh Flanagan](joshuaflanagan.lostechies.com/), and more recently [Brandon Behrens](http://brandonbehrens.blogspot.com/) and [Tim Tyrrell](http://blog.timtyrrell.net/) among many others.

Recently, at [Dovetail](http://www.dovetailsoftware.com), we migrated off of our Frankenstein’s Monster of customizations and bastardizations of the ASP.NET MVC 1.0 framework to the new FubuMVC framework (<del>specifically the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fubumvc/source/browse/#svn/branches/reboot">“reboot” branch</a></del>).

### Much Ado

So I think it’s time to officially announce FubuMVC as a real, honest-to-goodness maintained project with a future.

Official Web Site:  <http://www.fubu-project.org> (or specifically <http://mvc.fubu-project.org>)

Getting Started: <http://mvc.fubu-project.org/getting-started/>

Docs: <http://mvc.fubu-project.org/documentation/>

Wiki: <https://github.com/DarthFubuMVC/fubumvc/wiki>

Official Source Repo: <https://github.com/DarthFubuMVC/>

### Call for Help

Much of the core framework is already done and we’re using it in production already at Dovetail. But there is still a long and happy story yet to be told about Fubu and we’d like your help to make that story a reality!

Please check out the [Roadmap page on the wiki](https://github.com/DarthFubuMVC/fubumvc/wiki/Roadmap) to see how you can help.  Refresh this page often or check back to this blog as there will be updates and new project ideas flowing in regularly.
