A quick break from my (ir)regularly scheduled blog posts to point out something worth pointing out.

Recently, we upgraded to Community Server 2008.&#160; Our own Jason Meridth has spent countless hours in the evenings of his own time to do all this.

Just tonight, a reader wrote to request a fix for a bug that prevented him from printing out some of our posts. I tried to manage customer expectations and give Jason some time as he was still working through some lingering issues from the upgrade.

By the time I was done sending the email, Jason just fixed it! Awesome, Jason!

Now, back to your regularly scheduled posts :)
