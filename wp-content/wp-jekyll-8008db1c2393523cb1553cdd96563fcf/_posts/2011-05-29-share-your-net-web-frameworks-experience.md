Nothing like a good open-ended subjective question to get geeks riled up, right?

StackOverflow post: [OpenRasta vs FubuMVC vs Asp.net MVC just some thoughts](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6158737/openrasta-vs-fubumvc-vs-asp-net-mvc-just-some-thoughts/)

Though I think the &#8220;vs&#8221; in the title might be a little&#8230;provocative, I think we can keep this one civil since all three frameworks are quite nice and have a different focus.

Most of you reading this blog have used at least two of those frameworks. It would be nice it we could turn that SO question into a productive exposition of the strengths and weaknesses of each framework without dogging on the others.
