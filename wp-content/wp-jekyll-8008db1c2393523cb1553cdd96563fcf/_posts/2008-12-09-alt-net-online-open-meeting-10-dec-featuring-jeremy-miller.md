Zach Young has set up another LiveMeeting space for Wednesday (10-DEC-2008).

Last week we had a surprise visit from [Scott Bellware](http://blog.scottbellware.com/) (thanks Scott!) and discussed, among many other things,&#160; funding open source projects in .NET and managing projects using Lean and Kanbans.

This week, [Jeremy Miller](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/) is also planning on attending this meeting and is ready to do a show-and-tell on the state of his new [StoryTeller](http://storyteller.tigris.org/) testing framework project.
