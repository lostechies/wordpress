Also, [Jeremy Miller](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller) has [kindly volunteered](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2009/01/14/topics-for-tonight-s-van-call-1-14-09.aspx) to talk about the new StructureMap 2.5.2 release as well as “lessons learned” about building DSL’s in C#, so it should be a good meeting, as usual.

Hope to see you there!
