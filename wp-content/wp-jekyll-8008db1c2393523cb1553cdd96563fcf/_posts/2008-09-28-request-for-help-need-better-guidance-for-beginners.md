This morning I happened to see the article “[.NET Coding Standard & Code Review Points](http://www.dotnetfunda.com/articles/article62.aspx)” linked from the good folks over at [DotNetKicks.com](http://www.dotnetkicks.com).&#160; I was horrified to see some of the very bad guidance being offered here. While I appreciate and applaud the effort and time put in by Mr. Narayan, I feel very strongly that some his guidance can cause great harm to those beginners who might follow it seriously. I hope that you, my dear reader, at least partially agree that many of the elements of this article are just plain wrong, if not dangerous.

To try to turn a negative into a positive, I believe it is incumbent upon us to offer better guidance. Apparently there is a need here and we all are failing to deliver it.&#160; Producing high quality blog posts, contributing to mailing lists and community sites such as CodeProject, Stack Overflow, DotNetSlackers.com, and even the linked site (DotNetFunda.com) is a good start.&#160;&#160; It would also be nice, I think, to begin to collect these bits of wisdom and knowledge into a Wiki or some sort of permanent library/collection.

There’s currently the [AltNetPedia](http://www.altnetpedia.com) Wiki which has a lot of material on design, values, and practices but not so much on fundamentals.&#160; Is this a good place to start contributing, or is there another, better place that we should start contributing?&#160; Please let me know or post in comments and let’s get something started here.&#160; Let’s find a home and let’s all contribute at least a little bit to it.

We should welcome differing views and try not to make this library espouse a specific view and note these differences wherever possible. In the same vein, however, I will say that there are some practices and methods that are objectively wrong and harmful (such as not using the using(){} keyword when dealing with IDisposable implementations except in very specific circumstances) and these should also be noted in whatever literary artifacts are produced by this effort.

## The Plan

First we need to identify a home for this content.

Second, we need contributors and we’ll need some reviewers and editors to handle any glaring obvious problems (typos, spammers, trolls, etc).

Third, we need a higher level of reviewer/editor to try to pull things together, categorize/tag/organize, etc.

Fourth, we’ll need to encourage people to refer to this material and get the word out and encourage more contribution and review from the wider world.

Fifth, I don’t know yet, but I think we’ll be doing pretty good if we get to this point :)&#160; We’ll figure it out later.
