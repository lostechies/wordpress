** **Join the meeting here**: <http://Meeting.c4mvc.net> 

**Bio:** David is an architect on the ASP.NET team, which he was a part of since its very beginning in 1998. He has worked on many areas of the product, though his particular focus has been on the compilation system. More recently he has been working on ASP.NET Dynamic Data, and exciting new feature which aims to simplify the creation of data-driven web sites. 

**Topic:** David spent some time looking at how to reduce the noise in MVC views using some code generation technologies built into Visual Studio. He did this work and published through a series of blog posts. 

**Homework:&#160;** Read his first article to understand the problem he was trying to solve. The solution proposed in the first blog post changed dramatically so please read on to the additional posts. <http://blogs.msdn.com/davidebb/archive/2009/06/01/a-buildprovider-to-simplify-your-asp-net-mvc-action-links.aspx>
