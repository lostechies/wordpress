I started working with sandcastle to generate api documentation for the Asp.Net MVC &#8211; MvcContrib project ([http://MvcContrib.org](http://mvccontrib.org/)).&nbsp; I wanted to get some feedback as to how useful the general API Namespace/Class listings are. Below are two of the outputs of the documentation. I encourage you to take a quick look at it so that you can provide feedback.

Questions I need feedback on:
  



  


  1. Does having the Namespaces and classes browsable in this format provide and value as a user of the mvccontrib project?&nbsp;
  
      * If all of the feature documentation from the CodePlex wiki was included in the help file would that make a difference to the value that this documentation provides? (The wiki docs are located here: <http://www.codeplex.com/MVCContrib/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Documentation&referringTitle=Home>)
  
          * Is there a better way to provide general api documentation, do you have some examples of something you like?</OL></p>
