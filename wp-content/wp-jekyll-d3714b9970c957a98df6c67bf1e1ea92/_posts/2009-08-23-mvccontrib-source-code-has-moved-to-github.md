We recently moved the MvcContrib projects source code over to GitHub.&#160; We are hoping that the ease of creating forks and pulling them back into the trunk will allow for more contributions to the project.&#160; I know that GIT seems to be a source control system that few developers in the .Net space seem to know about but Jeremy Skinner created a great [tutorial](http://mvccontrib.github.com/MvcContrib/) specifically for the MvcContrib project.

&#160;

Here are the sections of the tutorial

&#160;

Continuous Integration is running on the Codebetter TeamCity server.&#160; Codebetter and Jetbrains have teamed up and are providing free build server for opensource projects.&#160; Below is the MvcContrib builds, we currently have 3 builds running.. the old Subversion source. the new Git Hub trunk, and a branch on GitHub that is compiled against the MVC 2 ctp. If you want to download the binaries you can do so by accessing the artifacts from the build server.&#160; When you go to the team city server it will prompt you for a login. Select the Login as Guest option.

The build server is located here [http://teamcity.codebetter.com/project.html?projectId=project10](http://teamcity.codebetter.com/project.html?projectId=project10 "http://teamcity.codebetter.com/project.html?projectId=project10")
