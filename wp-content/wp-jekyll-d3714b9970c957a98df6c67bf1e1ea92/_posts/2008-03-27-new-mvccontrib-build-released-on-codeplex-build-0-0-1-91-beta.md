**_What&#8217;s new in this release?_**  
The following items are changes from the previous release:


  


> 
  
> 
> 
> **Revision: 275**  
> - corrected some warnings/errors.  
> - added ViewDataExtensions. This brings the functionality of the smartbag to ViewData.  
> - now, we have easy adding and getting to and from ViewData. No more casting, and if you only put a single &#8220;Customer&#8221; in Viewdata using new Add() method, you just have to Get<Customer>(), and that&#8217;s it.  
> **Revision: 272**  
> Patch 1018 By:alley Added support for Unity as IoC container.  
> **Revision: 270**  
> Replaced all remaining occurrences of the MVCContrib namespace with MvcContrib.   
> **Rev 267**  
> - the ability to use TestControllerBuilder with controllers that have constructor arguments  
> - associated unit test  
>
