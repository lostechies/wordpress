&#160;

I am doing a Continuous Integration Workshop next Tuesday.&#160; The admission is free and will be held at the Microsoft Office.&#160; 

To register go here: [http://www.headspringsystems.com/services/agile-training/continuous-integration/](http://www.headspringsystems.com/services/agile-training/continuous-integration/ "http://www.headspringsystems.com/services/agile-training/continuous-integration/")

&#160;

This will cover the basics of what continuous integration is as well as the the advanced techniques like Database Configuration Management / Continuous Database Integration.&#160; At Headspring we implement CI on all of our projects and we can provide some perspective on applying CI to .Net applications.&#160; If there is anything of particular interest you would like to see at the workshop please feel free to comment below.

If you cannot attend this workshop I encourage you to read this book: _[Continuous Integration: Improving Software Quality and Reducing Risk](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321336380)_ and have a conversation with me.

See you then.
