We are really excited about this [conference](http://www.aspconf.net)! This is a free, online, two day conference that will focus on web development on using .Net.  We will have great speakers from the community and industry lined up. We already have speakers from Microsoft and Telerik, including a keynote with [Scott Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/).  The format of the conference will be live streaming of 1-2 hour presentations along with real time chat for each session.  There will be presentations on Html5, javascript, MVC, Web API, WebMatrix, Web Forms, SignalR, and more.

We are accepting Abstracts for sessions, so if you have something you would like to share with the community, please [submit a session](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dDRBYU85NXNMZ1JDRlBQZ1ViQ2UzaGc6MQ#gid=0).  We are also currently [accepting](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dFp3bFpUdnBOY1hpR1FjOTk4SEdNT3c6MA#gid=0) volunteers to help run the conference.

This conference is the evolution of [mvcConf](http://www.mvcconf.com), which was a one day event that had 27 sessions, they were all recorded and you can [view the videos on channel 9](http://channel9.msdn.com/series/mvcconf) . We had over 10k people attend the conference and over 750k videos viewed afterward. We expect this conference to be bigger and better, then mvcConf. While we are expanding the topics covered, I still expect to have the expert level topics that we had in mvcConf.

Go register now [Register Now](http://www.aspconf.net) for the conference.

If you want some more context around the conference the best way to give you some idea about it is to watch the keynote from the mvcConf2 .
