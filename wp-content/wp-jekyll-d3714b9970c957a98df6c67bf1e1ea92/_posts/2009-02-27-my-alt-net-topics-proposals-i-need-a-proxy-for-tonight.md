Here are my proposals&#160; for sessions, since I will not arrive until later tonight I am putting these up so that I can have a proxy submit them….

1. Scaffolding / Micro-Code generation.&#160; Fixing the “File – New File” problem/ friction in Visual Studio.&#160; I would be willing to show /demo **<a href="http://codeplex.com/flywheel" target="_blank">Flywheel</a>**

2. Sharing / Promoting working application and solution stacks.&#160; Fixing the “File – New Project“ problem.&#160; Tree surgeon did a great start but I want to promote a better way of getting new solutions started. What do you use to bring working application stacks to teams who have not worked this way before?&#160; Think about how we could distribute a sample or solution template for #Arch or FubuMVC or insert your favorite combination of frameworks and tools that deliver frictionless development that support Great software development practices. I would be willing to show/demo **<a href="http://codeplex.com/solutionfactory" target="_blank">Solution Factory</a>** 

3. I need a common assertion abstraction, don’t you?&#160; Testing DSL are killing me with their implementations around specific testing frameworks.
