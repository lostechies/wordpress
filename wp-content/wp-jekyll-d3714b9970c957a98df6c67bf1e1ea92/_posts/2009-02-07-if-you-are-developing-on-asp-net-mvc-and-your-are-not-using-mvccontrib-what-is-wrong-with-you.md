I just went through some stats from the MvcContrib project and I saw that we have had over 26k downloads.&nbsp; That makes me so happy to know that it is being used and it is filling a gap that is in the Asp.Net MVC framework.&nbsp; One of the goals of the MVC framework is to be extensible so that the community and developers could add the pieces that they need in a way that was easy.&nbsp; Compare this to the Asp.Net webforms.&nbsp; There were a limited number of ways to extend the framework and even than it could be very difficult.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Here is a chart that shows how the project has been used over the last year and a half.&nbsp; I am really excited to see that it has taken hold and it has delivered value. 

If you use MvcContrib, I want to say thank you.&nbsp; If you have developed something useful for the MVC Framework that others could use,&hellip; Please submit it to the project.&nbsp; 

If you have been trying out the Asp.Net MVC framework and have not tried out MvcContrib&hellip;. <a target="_blank" href="http://mvccontrib.org">well you need to go here and see what you are missing</a>.
