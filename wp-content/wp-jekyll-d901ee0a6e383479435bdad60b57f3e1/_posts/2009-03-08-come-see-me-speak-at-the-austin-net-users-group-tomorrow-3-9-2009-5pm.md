I am going to speak to the Austin .Net Users Group tomorrow.

This presentation will cover the basics of the Visual Studio Project system and its extensibility points.&#160; It will also cover some basics around creating Visual Studio Add-ins.

The code demonstrated in this presentation are part of two open source projects:

<http://codeplex.com/SolutionFactory>   
<http://codeplex.com/FlyWheel>

&#160;

I have learned a lot about the extensibility that is poorly documented but can be pretty powerful. I will show some of the features that were missing from Visual Studio that drove me to creating these Add-ins.
