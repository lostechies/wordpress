Although the company I work for is a consulting company and not a product company, we have dedicated hundreds of hours to Open Source Software projects in the Microsoft .Net Framework space.&#160; I am telling you this not to brag or get some sort of special award, but rather to set the context for this post.&#160; We have dedicated this much effort into Open Source projects because, we see value in sharing what we do and collaborating with others who believe in developing software that promotes a frictionless development processes.

Part of my job is to help get a handle on how we are supporting open source and to show that there are some benefits to our company by supporting these project from a business point of view.&#160; I am currently trying to figure out ways that we can promote some of what we do by leveraging the project websites as a way of promoting our training classes and other services which we could offer.&#160; 

This brings us to the reason for this post, the Codeplex website does not support some pretty simple mark up in their wiki. I am talking about being able to make a simple banner for our project sponsor(s).&#160; Am I asking for too much? At a time when the economy is struggling, we all need to work together to help do our little part to make the eco-system work.&#160; The great part about the team that works on codeplex is that they are pretty transparent.&#160; If this feature has enough votes on their tracking system, than it will get prioritized sooner.&#160; It is pretty cool of them to be open and honest about how their process works.&#160; The other project hosting sites have not been as easy to access as the codeplex team, so I am on a mission to get this feature prioritized.&#160; 

**_If you use an open source project as part of your daily work, than I ask you to do a favor for people like myself who helper run, code, and blog about open source software._**

If you want to support open source projects here is your call to action.
