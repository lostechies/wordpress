As part of a technical retreat we are doing for our company ( Headspring) , I thought I would put some posts together and in the name of transparency put this stuff out for others to see, comment, criticize or applaud. I will leave it up to you, which of those you wish to do.

&#160;

For the last year or so, [Headspring](http://www.headspringsystems.com/) has been giving free workshops in Austin.&#160; We decided to start recording them using the Camtasia screen cast tool (if you want to know more about how we do it, leave a comment), as a way to get more life and reach from our workshops.&#160; I have posted some links to the videos on my blog, after each event, but I wanted to point out that all of these videos plus videos from our people doing at user groups / code camps and such. 

Here is a list of what is available.

  * ASP.NET MVC from an Architect&#8217;s Perspective &#8211; Jimmy Bogard
  * ASP.NET MVC in Action &#8211; Jeffrey Palermo
  * Refactoring Workshop &#8211; Mahendra Mavani
  * TDD-DI-Soc-ASP-MVC &#8211; Jeffrey Palermo
  * Tarantino Database Migrations &#8211; Eric Hexter & Jeffrey Palermo
  * Continuous Integration Workshop Part 1 &#8211; 3 Eric Hexter & Jeffrey Palermo

Check out the videos, we see producing these as a way to help the community and ourselves.&#160; It is a way for us to get our name Headspring out there.&#160; It is a way for us to allow us to get feedback on our approaches. It allows us to help other developers who are not in Austin and may work for a company where there budget is so tight that they could not pay to go to training or get some people to come help them refine their development process.
