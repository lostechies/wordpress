&nbsp;

**MvcConf** is a **online conference** where you can learn about real experiences creating MVC applications as well about what the future holds for creating asp.net apps based on MVC.&nbsp; I have scheduled community members to present on intro and advanced topics using MVC2 and we have some Microsoft product members who will talk about some of the new stuff coming out soon.

**Prepare:** Before the conference go download the [Microsoft Live Meeting Client](http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/HA101733831033.aspx) the install is located at the bottom of the page.

I recommend scheduling a conference room if you and your team want to watch the presentations, or get a headset with a microphone so that you can ask questions over voice.
