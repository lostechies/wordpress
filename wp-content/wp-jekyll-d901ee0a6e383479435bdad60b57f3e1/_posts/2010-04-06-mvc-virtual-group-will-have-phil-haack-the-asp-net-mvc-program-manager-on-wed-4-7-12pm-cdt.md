I am excited to have [**Phil Haack**](http://www.Haacked.com) present to the [**Community For MVC**](http://www.c4mvc.net) ****virtual Usergroup. He is going to be presenting on the MVC 2 features.&#160; Now that it has been released, I hope anyone using MVC 1 gets their projects updated right now!

&#160;

To get the most out of the **Community for MVC** meeting, get out your old gaming **headset** with the **microphone**, because we take live audience questions in the name of learning!&#160; So come prepared and enjoy.

To join the meeting go to <http://Meeting.c4mvc.net> at **12 noon CDT (UTC â€“ 5) Tomorrow Wed 4/7**

&#160;

&#160;

If you have not heard of the **C4MVC** group before and you are doing ASP.Net MVC. Then you need to go checkout all of the **previous meetings**.&#160; We record the sessions and make them available on the website. 

Go check them out here: [http://www.c4mvc.net/Home/Events](http://www.c4mvc.net/Home/Events "http://www.c4mvc.net/Home/Events") I am sure they will blow your mind!
