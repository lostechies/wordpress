You can find the release here: [http://mvccontrib.codeplex.com/releases/view/43162](http://mvccontrib.codeplex.com/releases/view/43162 "http://mvccontrib.codeplex.com/releases/view/43162")

This project template includes a little msbuild trick to automatically include all of your content files as embedded resources, so you do not have to remember to manually keep track of them.&#160; This was a neat little trick that [Steve Michelotti](http://geekswithblogs.net/michelotti/Default.aspx) pulled together.

&#160;
