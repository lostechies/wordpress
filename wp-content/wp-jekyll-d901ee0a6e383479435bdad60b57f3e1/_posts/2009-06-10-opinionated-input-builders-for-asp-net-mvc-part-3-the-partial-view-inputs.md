This is the forth part of the series.&#160; 

Given this form that is generated by the input builders the partials for each data type of the Model are selected by the builder based on a simple convention.

&#160;     <img style="border-right-width: 0px;border-top-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="//lostechies.com/erichexter/files/2011/03/image_4376DF07.png" width="644" height="362" />

Each partial control is selected using the following convention:

  1. The type of the property is used to find a Partial View by the same name. 
  2. If the partial does not exist in the /Views/Shared/ directory it is pulled from an embedded resource from the Input Builder assembly.&#160; This allows you to override the conventions of the framework with your own. 
  3. If a PartialView Attribute is applied to a property it is used to override the previous conventions. 
  4. Display a partial using a Chained Method on the Input() method UsingPartial( partialName ) 

Looking at the types of the model you can see that the Enum partial will render a Select element by default.&#160; The PartialView(“RadioButtons”) attribute was applied to override the default and have the build render the RadioButtons.aspx partial view.

&#160;

This is an example of using the Chained Method override instead of using an attribute based approach.

 <img style="border-right-width: 0px;border-top-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lostechies.com/erichexter/files/2011/03/image_60530D1B.png" width="875" height="295" />

This convention of utilizing the partial views allows the separation of concerns (SoC) of the markup from the conventions which determine which partial to render.

**What if you do not like the convention ?????** &#160; Each part of the UI model is extensible.&#160; There are two conventions that are at play here.&#160; The selection of the partial view and the selection of the data that is used by the controls to display the possible selections.&#160; This is shown for the enum data types which allows the select and radio button inputs to display a list of possible values.&#160; 

&#160;

The ModelPropertyFactory class calls two methods to execute the conventions.&#160; The ParialNameConvention and ModelPropertyBuilder by using the static Func fields this will allow your project to define your own conventions if you do not like mine.&#160; This is an important extensibility point that gives the great flexibility to this approach.&#160; There are conventions like this for each of the elements used within the partials.&#160;
