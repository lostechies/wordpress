I am excited to have a chance to speak to the <a href="http://www.alamocoders.net/" target="_blank">Alamo Coders user group</a> about Silverlight 2.0.&nbsp; I am planing on covering some general information about Silverlight and where if fits in the overall technology stack against some of the other technologies like AIR and FLEX.&nbsp; I do plan on demonstrating the areas that I think makes it a legitimate Application platform which is it&#8217;s built in support for testability and rich APIs.&nbsp; 

The meeting will be at&nbsp; Tuesday July 8th at 6:00pm at the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=l&hl=en&geocode=&q=New+Horizons&near=San+Antonio,+TX&sll=29.531793,-98.672588&sspn=0.006282,0.010042&ie=UTF8&ei=wevnRq2jJKXSrQKxgqiPBg&cd=1&dtab=5&cid=29515251,-98555474,17178413233909865539&li=lmd&z=14&t=m" target="_blank">New Horizons Learning Center</a> .&nbsp; If you are near San Antonio feel free to drop in and see me!
