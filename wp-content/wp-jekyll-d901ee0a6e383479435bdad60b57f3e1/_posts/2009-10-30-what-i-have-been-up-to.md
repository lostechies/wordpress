I have been pretty busy over the last few weeks. I just wanted to document what I have been doing.

&#160;

[<img style="border-bottom: 0px;border-left: 0px;margin: 0px 10px 0px 0px;border-top: 0px;border-right: 0px" border="0" alt="image" align="left" src="http://lostechies.com/erichexter/files/2011/03/image_thumb_04517FAF.png" width="244" height="66" />](http://lostechies.com/erichexter/files/2011/03/image_6BC1E25E.png) I co-presented a free Advanced ASP.Net MVC half day with Jeffrey Palermo in Austin.&#160; We had a good group of people show up to the Austin Microsoft office.&#160; As I was preparing and presenting the session, it has become very obvious how much 

&#160;

I co-presented with [Jackson Harper](http://twitter.com/jacksonh) from the Mono team at [Monospace](http://monospace.us/) on Mono and the Web ASP .NET MVC, WebForms, Tools, and Servers.&#160; In preparation for this session I took the code camp server, codebase and got it running with Mono on openSuseâ€¦ yeah that Linux, That means that ASP.Net MVC, StructureMap, NHibernate, Automapper, Castle Validators, and MvcContrib all work on mono and are **binary compatible**!&#160; I was able to compile the application in Visual Studio and using the MonoVS plugin deploy a vm.&#160; We also demonstrated ftping the bits to a Linode and Jackson showed how to get is all setup.&#160; He even made a Virtual Appliance that when you start it up in vmware it will be running the application on the web server..&#160; You can get the slides, link to the mono version of the source code, download the virtual appliance from the mini site that was setup for the talk. <http://MonoOnTheWeb.info> .&#160; I thought it was pretty cool seeing all of this stuff work.&#160; It was a great way to prove out that the application stack that Headspring uses can be deployed on a wide range of platforms which ultimately opens up our potential customer base.

I had the chance to present **Database Change Management** as the InnoTech conference.&#160; It was pretty good to get out and see a group of people that I have not seen before.&#160; I sometimes feel like I am in the Austin .Net bubble so while I presented some code samples in .Net using SQL server I really tried to present the information as being agnositc of you database platform.&#160; Good development techniques can transcend technology and platforms.
