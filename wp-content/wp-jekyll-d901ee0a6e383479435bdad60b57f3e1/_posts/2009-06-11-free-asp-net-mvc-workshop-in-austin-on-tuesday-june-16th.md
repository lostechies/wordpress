I am doing a half day workshop at the Microsoft Office in Austin around ASP.Net MVC.&#160; I did this in February with <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/jimmy_bogard/" target="_blank">Jimmy Bogard</a> and we had about 90 people show up, it was a pretty good event. We will cover a lot of what we have learned using the framework on a number of large enterprise project at <a href="http://www.headspringsystems.com" target="_blank">Headspring Systems</a>.&#160; This time I am doing the workshop with <a href="http://jeffreypalermo.com/" target="_blank">Jeffrey Palermo</a> and we will cover a portion of the presentation he gave to the Austin Code Camp.&#160; After that I think I will dive into some features around getting things done with the framework.&#160; See Jeffreyâ€™s <a href="http://jeffreypalermo.com/blog/afternoon-of-asp-net-mvc-16-june-free-headspring-event/" target="_blank">post</a> for some more details.
