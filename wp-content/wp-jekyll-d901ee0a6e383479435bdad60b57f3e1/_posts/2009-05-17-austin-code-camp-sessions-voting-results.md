Keeping with total transparency in the way that we run the Austin Code Camp: below are the results for the voting for sessions.&#160; The voting is used for the following purposes: 

1. This allow speakers who submitted multiple sessions to decide to pull their least popular session.   
2. This list allows us to properly schedule&#160; sessions in the correctly sized room.&#160; The St Edwards Professional Center has a large number of rooms of varying sizes so it is really important to make sure we arrange the schedule so that we can distribute the most popular sessions throughout the day.&#160; 

I though publishing this information publicly may be of interest to everyone in the .Net Community thinking it would be good to understand where the general interests in software development are.&#160; I think it is pretty cool that they is a huge interest in patterns and practices. It is clear that developers want to do things the right way and are looking for clear direction on just how to implement these in real code.
