A month back I was on a mission to get a feature included in Codeplex that would allow my projects to better support the companies which fund my projects.&#160; I reached out to the community to help vote this feature up from somewhere in the lower 400s to the number one (1) position.&#160; The Codeplex team implemented the feature and pushed it live in the matter of weeks.&#160; I talked with one of the team members at Teched and they told me the feature would have made it up a week earlier but there was an across the board focus from the company to test out their latest product.

&#160; I was so glad to have such an awesome response from the team.. I have hosted Open Source projects on Codeplex , Google Code and Source Forge and I must say I have never had this type of interaction with Google Code or Source Forge.&#160; While I dislike the source control system&#160; with Codeplex, I have to say that to have a team that is that focused and transparent is just awesome.&#160; Soâ€¦ huge props to Codeplex.&#160; Having a team that is willing actually listen to the users is a huge reason to consider codeplex for your open source projects.
