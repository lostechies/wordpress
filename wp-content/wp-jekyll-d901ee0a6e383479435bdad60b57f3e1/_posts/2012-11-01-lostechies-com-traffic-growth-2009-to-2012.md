I was looking at some pageviews on google analytics (GA) and and comparing my pageviews to the rest of the traffic on the site. This made me realize I could not pull the type of report I wanted from GA.&nbsp; I wanted to compare the results of some searches against the urls on the site.&nbsp; The cool thing is that since we use GA on the site, I was able to pull this data together even though we switched from Community Server to WordPress and the base portions of our urls changed.&nbsp; I was able to find most people by their last name and then pull the numbers..

I pulled a report to summarize traffic by week and then looked at the top twenty five posts that by pageviews for the last 3 years, I then pulled individual reports for each of the bloggers that had a post in that top 25 list. The result is what I found below,&nbsp; I had to compile all the data manually in excel, if it was easier I would have split up the Rest of the traffic into all the bloggers on Lostechies, but I just did not have the energy to keep clicking export in GA, and copy and paste in excel.&nbsp; What is cool, is that you can see the large spikes in traffic from when specific posts were made internet famous, like the Solid Posters or Jimmy&#8217;s scrum post. I can also see how Dereckâ€™s current focus on javascript is much more interesting to the internet then some of the other focus on agile or .net programing.
