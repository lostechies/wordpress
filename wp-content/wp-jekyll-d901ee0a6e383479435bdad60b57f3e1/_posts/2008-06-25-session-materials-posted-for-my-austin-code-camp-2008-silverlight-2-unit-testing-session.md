I have been really busy between starting as a Principal Consultant for Headspring Systems and a long awaited vacation.&nbsp; I am just   
catching up on some blog posts. 

My Silverlight Unit Testing session at the <a href="http://austincodecamp.com/" target="_blank">Austin Code Camp 2008</a> went really well.&nbsp;&nbsp; The source code and presentation is available for download <a href="http://code.google.com/p/austincodecamp08/downloads/detail?name=SilverlightUnitTesting.zip&can=2&q=#makechanges" target="_blank">here</a>.   
I got some great feedback and look forward to being able to speak on the topic some more!

&nbsp;

I wanted to formally thank <a href="http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/johnteague/" target="_blank">John Teague</a> for all of his hard work organizing the code camp.&nbsp; With a new baby at home there was no way I could have organized   
it this year so I was happy to have John pull it together while I was able to focus on sponsorships and swag.&nbsp; I think it was a great event and I will have a retrospective   
with John so that we can share all that we have learned about running a camp as well as how to successfully hand off the execution from one person to the next.   
I think there is more value in being able to grow a community where we have more leaders who can execute these types of events and I believe we have some   
great lessons to share.

There is some great material for all of the code camp sessions on our code camp source repository.&nbsp; Please check it out <a href="http://code.google.com/p/austincodecamp08/downloads/list" target="_blank">here</a>.
