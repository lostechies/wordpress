Early this week we&#160; ( [Jeffrey Palermo](http://jeffreypalermo.com) and I ) gave a [Continuous Integration Workshop](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/hex/archive/2009/09/10/free-continuous-integration-workshop-in-austin-tuesday-sept-15th-1pm-5pm.aspx) in Austin.&#160; We were able to record the workshop and our company [Headspring Systems](http://Headspringsystems.com) made the recordings available on their website. There is just under 3 hours of video covering the following topics:

  * reducing risks using CI 
  * automated builds 
  * automated deployments 
  * building software at every change 
  * continuous database integration 
  * continuous testing 
  * continuous inspection 
  * Software Configuration Management (SCM)

&#160;

These are **not** professional videos by any means, but there seemed to be some interest in hearing **how we do ci**. I am personally excited that we have these videos because it will help me improve how I present this information in the future.

You can view the **videos** and **download the slides** from here:

Enjoy!
