I know I’ve been remiss in my blog posting duties. Please trust me when I say it’s for good reason and that you’d understand.

I appreciate you sticking with me. In the meantime, here are a few tidbits that you might find worth noting:

## Announcing: Zen

[Nate Kohari](http://kohari.org) (whom I’d like to call a friend, though I’m not sure he feels the same way, lol) has just announced the coming-out party of a skunk-works project he and [his wife Nicole](http://nikibeth.com/)&#160; have been cooking up for quite some time now. It’s a lightweight (but powerful) lean project management system using Kanban. Nate can describe it better, so I’ll let you hear it straight from him:

Zen Home Page:&#160; <http://agilezen.com>

Nate’s Blog post: <http://kohari.org/2009/06/09/zen-and-the-art-of-project-management/>

Side note: I’m taking votes for who has more attractive eyewear Nate or Nicole.

## Steven Bohlen speaking for VAN on DDD

Zachariah Young wanted me to let ya’ll know that Steven Bohlen (of “[Summer of NHibernate](http://www.summerofnhibernate.com/)” and “Streaking through campus naked” fame) will be presenting about Domain-driven Design at the next VAN (June 10).

The details for attending are here (I suggest you check it out!):

Site note: His “streaking on campus” days are over, to be clear, there will be no streaking at the VAN)

## .NET Slackers Article on StructureMap 101

After many broken promises and terrible delays, I finally delivered my first article to the ever patient, polite, and positive Sonu Kapor (one of the organizers of [www.dotnetslackers.com](http://www.dotnetslackers.com)).
