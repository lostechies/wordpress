That&#8217;s it. Just do it. Yes, I know&#8230; I understand&#8230; Stop thinking about excuses for no and start thinking about reasons for Yes.&nbsp; 

It&#8217;s a really cool place. There is hip happening stuff going in the .NET, Java, Ruby, and Python spaces (among many others).&nbsp; The [weather is awesome](http://www.weather.com/weather/local/78704). We&#8217;re going to have several ALT.NET-type events a year. Thriving .NET user group, on and on.

My wife said I&#8217;m crazy for wanting to saturate the market down here with high-end .NET folks and limit my hiring opportunities. I see it the other way around. The more strong people we have here, the more companies will be compelled to start development in Austin.&nbsp; We won&#8217;t have too many fish in the pond because the pond will be constantly growing!

In fact, I&#8217;m talking with a company that&#8217;s based out on the East coast and they&#8217;re having problems putting together a team out there and they&#8217;re debating about whether they should start a team here in Austin.&nbsp; Already it&#8217;s starting to happen. Critical mass is brewing. Are you going to be a part of the Next Big Thing(tm)?
