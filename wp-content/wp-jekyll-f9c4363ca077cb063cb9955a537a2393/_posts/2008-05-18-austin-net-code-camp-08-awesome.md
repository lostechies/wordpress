Yesterday a bunch of .NET geeks descended upon Austin for the &#8217;08 Code Camp and it was a great success. From what I heard, about ~200 folks showed up. We had sessions all day and all of them were meaty, good stuff. I don&#8217;t recall seeing one single vendor salesware demo. Every presentation had meat in it (even the vendor ones). There were several patterns/practices talks and we even got to do a fishbowl on TDD/BDD practices.

Please indulge me in a few acknowledgements. Please also forgive me for all the people I&#8217;m about to miss and offend.&nbsp; I&#8217;d like to especially thank John Teague and Eric Hexter who, from what I understand, organized the whole thing. I&#8217;d like to thank all the speakers, especially [Ben Scheirman](http://www.flux88.com) and [Jimmy Bogard](jimmybogard.lostechies.com) who both led 4+ sessions EACH!&nbsp; I&#8217;d also like to thank the sponsors who helped make it possible and provided lunch and a bunch of snacks and drinks. Lastly but not least, I&#8217;d like to thank all the attendees who really made it a great conference and really help energize the atmosphere and inspire everyone to try harder to make the .NET community in central Texas even more lively.

It was also good to see the Los Techies crew representin&#8217; (Jimmy Bogard, [Joe Ocampo](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/joe_ocampo), and [Eric Hexter](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/hex/default.aspx)).
