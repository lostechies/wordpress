In preparation for the upcoming 2.5 release of StructureMap, and since I can&#8217;t stand SourceForge&#8217;s mailing list and forum capabilities, I set up a mailing list via Google Groups for users of StructureMap to discuss usage, give and receive support, etc.

We&#8217;d like to start moving all support and discussion to the mailing list (instead of the SourceForge forums).

Anyone can subscribe and post to the mailing list via email or online from this link:   
<http://groups.google.com/group/structuremap-users>

You can also subscribe or unsubscribe via email at the following address:   
<structuremap-users@googlegroups.com>

You can track the discussion via RSS using this URL:   
<http://groups.google.com/group/structuremap-users/feeds>
