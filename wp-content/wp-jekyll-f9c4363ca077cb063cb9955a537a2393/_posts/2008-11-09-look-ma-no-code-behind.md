I’ve been playing with some MVC-related stuff and one of the things I took a second to look at was not having to have a code behind in order to do the whole ViewPage<MODEL> business.

I came up with this:

[<img style="border-top-width: 0px;border-left-width: 0px;border-bottom-width: 0px;border-right-width: 0px" height="241" alt="no_code_behind" src="http://lostechies.com/chadmyers/files/2011/03/no_code_behind_thumb.png" width="526" border="0" />](http://lostechies.com/chadmyers/files/2011/03/no_code_behind_2.png) 

## &#160;

## Thoughts?

Yes, it works.&#160; Code forthcoming (it’s incubating right now – this is part of a larger chunk of code I do plan on releasing).

Do you like this approach?&#160; Should I continue heading down this path?
