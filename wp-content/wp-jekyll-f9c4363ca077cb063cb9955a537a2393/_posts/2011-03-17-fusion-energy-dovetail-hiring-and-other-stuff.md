## Nuclear Fusion!

Today at the [ATX Code Lunch](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/atx-code-lunch) (if you haven’t come yet, you’re missing out!), I was talking with some folks about the Fukushima nuclear fission reactor situation in Japan. I mentioned a fascinating Google Video I saw of Robert Bussard talking about the state of nuclear _fusion_ power generation. I promised I’d paste it on my blog for everyone to watch:

## Dovetail Hiring (again)

In other news that is almost as cool as nuclear fusion, Dovetail is hiring again. This time we’ve got THREE (count ‘em) openings. One for [a senior .NET team lead/developer](http://www.dovetailsoftware.com/senior-net-technical-lead), another for [a .NET developer](http://www.dovetailsoftware.com/.NET%20Developers), and one for [a marketing director](http://www.dovetailsoftware.com/marketing-director) (if you happen to know one).&#160; And be sure to keep an eye on [our careers page](http://www.dovetailsoftware.com/careers)!
