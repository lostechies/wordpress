Can someone please make a &#8220;virus&#8221; that removes Comic Sans from PCs? 

The optimal vector, I think, would be through an attachment to or link contained in a &#8220;FORWARD THIS TO 10 PEOPLE OR THE BABY KITTENS ALL DIE&#8221; emails and it&#8217;ll spread like wildfire. 

Combined with a twitter link to a bogus app that will tell you &#8220;Which celebrities are secretly following you on twitter?&#8221; and a Facebook app to tell you your &#8220;Compatibility score with celebrity Facebook profiles&#8221;, you should cover 99.9% of the Internet in less than 24 hours.
