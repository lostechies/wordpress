(I’m sure [Gary Sherman](http://blogs.dovetailsoftware.com/users/gsherman), Dovetail CTO, won’t mind if I copy [his post](http://blogs.dovetailsoftware.com/blogs/gsherman/archive/2011/02/08/dovetail-is-hiring-a-junior-to-mid-level-net-developer) verbatim)

Dovetail is hiring a junior to mid-level .NET Developer.

We&#8217;re expanding the development team on our line of existing products. You&#8217;ll be working on a small team that develops applications for large businesses using some of the latest technology. You will be involved in all aspects of solution development, including analysis, design, development, testing, documentation, and support.

We’re looking for a software developer with demonstrable C# and HTML/CSS experience (FUBU MVC or ASP.NET MVC is a plus). Any experience with test-driven development or automated unit testing in general is a huge plus. Also, participation in the community (attendance of events, avid blog reader + commenter, or maybe you even have a blog yourself) will put you firmly in the running for this position. We’re looking for people that believe learning and continuous improvement are primary responsibilities of a software developer. We’re hiring motivated people for a terrific opportunity with a team of recognized .NET and agile community leaders.

Our practices and technologies include:

  * Test-driven development 
  * Continuous integration 
  * Domain-driven design 
  * HTML, CSS, Javascript (jQuery) 
  * ASP .NET MVC 
  * FUBU MVC 
  * C# 3.0, .NET 3.5 
  * SQL 2008 
  * Oracle 
  * NHibernate 
  * StructureMap
