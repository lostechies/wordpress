</p> 

Last Wednesday, a few of us had an impromptu LiveMeeting chat to talk about [Fluent NHibernate](code.google.com/p/fluent-nhibernate).&#160; I thought it went well enough. It wasn’t scripted so the conversation meandered considerably, but I think everyone got a little out of it.&#160; We decided to try it again, but crank it up a notch and make it more official like with a prescribed time and maybe even (if we’re lucky :) ) a real agenda and something to talk about and demonstrate.</p> </p> 

Details:

> When:&#160; Wednesday, August 20th @ 8:30PM CDT [UTC-05:00]&#160; (9:30PM EDT, 7:30PM MDT, 6:30PM PDT, 2:30AM BST on the 21st)
> 
> Where: Live Meeting. URL, etc below
> 
> Why:&#160; To show what the Fluent NHibernate API is currently, what it may become, and to discuss it
> 
> Who:&#160; Currently, it’s Zachariah Young of the Northwest Arkansas .NET User’s Group and me (Chad Myers).
> 
> How: The final plans aren’t made yet, but it will likely be a quick code walk-through/presentation with commentary then questions and then finally some form of open discussion.

Please drop a comment here to RSVP if you plan on attending so we can get an idea of head count.&#160; It’s OK if you don’t RSVP, but the presentation won’t be as good because we won’t be expecting as many people.
