[Zach Young](http://www.zachariahyoung.com) has gone to the trouble to set up a [Google Group for VAN](http://groups.google.com/group/virtualaltnet).&#160; I recommend you subscribe to the list and give some feedback if you can! He’ll be posting announcements and URLs for future events.

I’ll keep posting announcements here for awhile (or indefinitely, depending on how things go), so you shouldn’t have to worry about missing things.

Also, I know several of you in Europe can’t make it (since it’s usually 3AM in the UK). This might be a good place for getting info on setting up a Europe-friendly one.
