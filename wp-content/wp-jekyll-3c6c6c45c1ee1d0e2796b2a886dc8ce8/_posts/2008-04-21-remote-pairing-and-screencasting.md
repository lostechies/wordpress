I&#8217;m starting to question the value of blogging as a way of rallying community efforts.&nbsp; I&#8217;m inclined to focus more on article-style blogging vs. conversational-style blogging and moving the conversation to Skype+VNC and recording the interactions and minimally producing screencasts of interesting interactions.

I&#8217;m not sure how it&#8217;ll all work and I definitely need help with the logistics and any recommendations anyone has is welcome.&nbsp; As a &#8216;prove me wrong&#8217; experiment, I&#8217;d like to try to rally-via-blog folks to do screen casts with each other and, hopefully, a few with me (I want to learn too, please!).&nbsp; Any advice as to which software to use for voice (Skype?)&nbsp; for screen viewing (VNC?) for capturing video (Camtasia? CamStudio?) for capturing audio, post-production, etc would be greatly appreciated.
