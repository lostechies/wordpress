Until today, in order to start using Fluent NHibernate, you had to pull the trunk from Subversion and build it yourself.&#160; It wasn’t a big deal, but it was a small barrier to entry for some new folks just approaching Fluent NHibernate for the first time.

But thanks to the efforts of [James Gregory](http://blog.jagregory.com/) and the rest of the [Fluent NHibernate](http://fluentnhibernate.org) team, compiled binaries are being prepared every time someone commits.

If you’re looking to play with Fluent NHibernate, but haven’t had a chance to pull the trunk and go through the hassle of building, now you can just grab the binaries!

Check it out here:

Also the source is zipped up every commit for easier grab-n-go action.
