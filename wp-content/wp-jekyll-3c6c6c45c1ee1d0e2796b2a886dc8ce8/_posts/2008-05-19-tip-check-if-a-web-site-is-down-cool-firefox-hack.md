I was having problems connecting to a web site and I managed to stumble into a web site via Google to check to see if a web site is really down or not (get a second opinion) and I found this site:

[http://www.computerhope.com/cgi-bin/isitup.cgi](http://www.computerhope.com/cgi-bin/isitup.cgi "http://www.computerhope.com/cgi-bin/isitup.cgi")

But even cooler than that, they had a tip for FireFox that allows you to bookmark that URL and assign a &#8216;keyword&#8217; to it. I hadn&#8217;t seen this before, but apparently it&#8217;s an old feature in FireFox.

So now I can just type: ping [www.yahoo.com](http://www.yahoo.com)

And it takes me to the computerhope link above and tells me whether it&#8217;s up or not. Sweet!
