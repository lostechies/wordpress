Today was my first day back with [Dovetail Software](http://www.dovetailsoftware.com/).&nbsp; It was good to be back with a familiar crew. For those that don&#8217;t know, I used to work for Dovetail under it&#8217;s former name (First Choice Software) with [Gary Sherman](http://blogs.dovetailsoftware.com/blogs/gsherman/), [Kevin Miller](http://blogs.dovetailsoftware.com/blogs/kmiller/), [Sam Tyson](http://blogs.dovetailsoftware.com/blogs/styson/default.aspx), and several others.&nbsp; [Jeremy Miller](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/default.aspx) started today, also.&nbsp; So I&#8217;ll be back in action with him &#8212; which I view as a really cool thing. I learned a ton from him in the few short weeks together at our last gig, so I look forward to having more time at this gig for more learning!&nbsp; I&#8217;m planning on requesting the title, &#8216;Assistant Code Monkey&#8217; (which I&#8217;m sure will quickly be corrected to say &#8216;Assistant **<u>TO </u>**the Code Monkey&#8217;).

I would be remiss if I didn&#8217;t put in the disclaimer that Jeremy and I are NOT to be confused with the 1960&#8242;s British invasion folk duo band: [Chad & Jeremy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_and_Jeremy)
