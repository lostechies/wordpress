This is a portion of a larger set of posts on the [subject of Internal DSLs](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/chad_myers/archive/2008/10/26/alt-net-workshops-internal-dsl-draft-outline-notes.aspx). 

Nested Function is a pattern explained by Martin Fowler as part of his DSL book work in progress. Fowler’s take on [Nested Functions](http://martinfowler.com/dslwip/NestedFunction.html) is useful to more fully understand this post (and probably realize some of this post’s flaws).
