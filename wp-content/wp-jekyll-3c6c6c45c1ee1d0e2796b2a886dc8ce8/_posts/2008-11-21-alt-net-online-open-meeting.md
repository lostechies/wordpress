As you may recall, last week I announced the [ALT.NET Online Open Meeting](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/chad_myers/archive/2008/11/17/announcing-alt-net-online-open-meeting.aspx).&#160; We met last Wednesday night and had a pretty good chat about all sorts of topics.&#160; I think at one point we had 45 people attending!

The topic started with OpinionatedMVC, MVC in general, wandered around a little bit, and then finally settled into KanBan.

All in all, I think the open format “kinda” worked. I really wish we had a way for people to “break out” and discuss side issues without having to listen to the “main” discussion.&#160;&#160; We’re looking into ways to have breakouts including side-by-side Live Meetings, breakouts within Live Meeting, or encouraging people to mute the main discussion and have their own Skype conversations.

## Recordings

Zach Young has posted the recordings to both the first meeting and this most recent second meeting here:
