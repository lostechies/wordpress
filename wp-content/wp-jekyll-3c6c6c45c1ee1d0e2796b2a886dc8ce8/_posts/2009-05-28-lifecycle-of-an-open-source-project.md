I’ve had several people ask me about the state of various open source projects that I’m involved with or advocate.&#160; They ask questions such as “Is it alpha or beta?”, “Should we start using it?”, and “Where can I get started learning more?”.

I find these questions difficult to answer since they’re very relative and subjective depending on your environment, tolerance for change, tolerance for bugs, issues with “bleeding edge” technology, etc.&#160; 

In an effort to try to come up with a more objective framework for answering these types of questions, I decided to take a stab at putting into words my experience with various frameworks and how they have progressed in their lifecycle.

## Phase 1: Concept

Some ideas have been kicked around by a few people. Some spike code has been written. A project site is up (Google Code, CodePlex, etc) and there is maybe a working prototype to show off and talk about.&#160; Definitely no documentation, wiki, or anything like that. There may be a blog post or two about the concepts.

## Phase 2: Bootstrap

There are one or two serious authors/committers.&#160; There might already be one or two actual users experimenting with the framework.&#160; The build is continually in a “works on my machine!" state.&#160; Some more blog posts have been done and maybe a wiki with a few articles, but otherwise no docs to speak of.

## Phase 3: Early Development 

A few more committers have signed on, but still there is only one or two primary contributors. A few more users have started playing with it now and are providing feedback.&#160; A mailing list has certainly been set up by now, if not earlier. The build is more stable and works in many environments.&#160; More blog posts and wiki articles have emerged, but still no serious documentation effort yet.

## Phase 4: Early Adoption 

More committers are signing on now and contributing more and more.&#160; The project is at a state with many of the baseline features are done and the product is quite usable now.&#160; There are a few dozen users experimenting with it and even building some interesting applications upon it.&#160; Multiple people are blogging about it. The wiki is starting to materialize into categories and sub-topics.&#160; Some sparse documentation has started to emerge in the form of some limited API docs and some FAQ’s and getting started guides.

## Phase 5: Development 

There are several devoted committers now, cranking out serious features and functionality.&#160; There are dozens of users – approaching 100 or more.&#160; There is an automated (nightly?) build. Binaries are available for download regularly.&#160; Many people are blogging about it and buzz is growing.&#160; The wiki is really taking shape and being fleshed out.&#160; At this point documentation is “moderate” and is growing into more scenarios and topics. 

## Phase 6: Adoption

Many people are submitting patches and other forms of contributions. The inner circle of committers is growing.&#160; There are more than 100 users, perhaps several hundred.&#160; There are frequent “point” releases available for download. There’s now likely a basic installer which helps configure your environment for the framework.&#160; Frequent, in-depth blog posts by noted authors.&#160; The Wiki is now very rich and there are frequent contributions.&#160; Documentation at this point is “adequate”.&#160; You would likely start seeing “contrib” projects sprouting up here and there and coalescing .

## Phase 7: Maturity

There are so many patches and contributors that a hierarchy has been set up to evaluate and approve changes.&#160; Multiple releases creates management issues with patches and defects requiring more organization. There over a thousan users by now and like thousands.&#160; There are releases and installers for various scenarios (maybe x86/x64, or a Mono compatible release, etc).&#160; There is lots of documentation activity and many contrib projects have emerged.

## Phase 8: Mainstream 

By now, many of the original contributors have moved on or are less involved. A new generation of contributors have taken over and are taking the project into different directions and expanding it greatly.&#160; There are hundreds of thousands of users. Perhaps there are even consulting companies forming business services around the project and offering commercial support.&#160; There are now multiple “dot-oh” releases. There is no doubt this project is here to stay and provides real value to people.&#160; The project has its own active web site with lots of content, guides, add-ons, forums, blogs, etc.
