I’m pleased to announce there’s a new blogger on the Los Techies blog roll: Ryan Rauh.

Ryan is a high-energy guy and has his hands in a lot of new tech out there, so expect some exciting blog posts from him.

He’s into JavaScript, FubuMVC, HTML5/CSS3, UI/UX, and general .NET and programming related things.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you went to the last Pablo’s Fiesta, you may have attended his impromptu session on JavaScript functions which received high praise from a number of attendees.&nbsp; Look for cool stuff coming from Ryan soon!
