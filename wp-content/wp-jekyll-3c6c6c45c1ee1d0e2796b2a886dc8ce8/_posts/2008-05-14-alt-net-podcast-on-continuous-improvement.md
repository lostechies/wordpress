[Mike Moore](http://www.blowmage.com/) recently put together a [podcast about ALT.NET and Continuous Improvement](http://altnetpodcast.com/episodes/1-continuous-improvement) featuring [Jeremy Miller](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/default.aspx), [David Laribee](http://codebetter.com/blogs/david_laribee/), and, in order to make the other guys sound smarter, me.

Please check it out and let us all know what you think!

From what I understand, the &#8216;Alt.NET Podcast&#8217; folks are planning on doing many more episodes, so you may want to subscribe to their feed and stay on top of it in the future.
