This is a comedy goldmine that I wanted to share with you.

Remember all that stuff you hated about WebForms? Yeah, it’s really just that you don’t know what you’re doing and if you just tried harder, it’s really not that bad (kinda like ‘If I just obey him, he won’t beat me’).

Also, apparently the TextBox control in WebForms has a MultiLine mode which “violates LSP” (yes, he even spells out ‘Liskov Substitution Principle’ as if to punctuate the mistake). I have NO idea where they came up with that one.

Finally, if you complain about code in code-behinds, he won’t ever consider you for a hire ever again. Phew! At least I won’t have to worry about working with this guy every again.

Enjoy:
