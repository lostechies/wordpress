We&#8217;ll also be giving away a few prizes including a full copies of Windows Vista Ultimate, Office 2007 Ultimate, Visual Studio 2008 Standard Edition, FOUR copies of JetBrains’ ReSharper product!

<u>**NOTE**</u>: Please check back as this page may be updated. There are a few things in the works that you may find interesting (more prizes, possibly an evening event on Friday night, and a few other interesting things!)

# What

Pablo&#8217;s Days of TDD – Workshops, Labs, and Discussions around the practice of TDD.&#160; NOTE: Space _is_ limited, so please sign up using the link at the bottom (please read through all the stuff, too :) ). We’re doing this as a first-come, first-serve basis, so the sooner you register the better.

We’ve set up a [Google Code project + wiki](http://code.google.com/p/daysoftdd/wiki/PablosDaysofTDDOct3And4) where we’re trying to prepare all the materials and such. Feel free to peruse and, if you want, join the project and help us out!

The plan is to have [Workshops](http://code.google.com/p/daysoftdd/wiki/Workshop) and [Labs](http://code.google.com/p/daysoftdd/wiki/Lab) for novice- to intermediate-level practitioners.&#160; For intermediate- to advanced-level practitioners, there will be at least one room dedicated to [open/free-form discussions](http://code.google.com/p/daysoftdd/wiki/OpenDiscussion). We’ve asked Jeremy Miller ([The ShadeTree Developer](http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/), and friend of the Los Techies crew) if he can help lead a discussion or two on some advanced testing practices.

# How Much?

FREE, Thanks to our sponsors!

# Who should attend?

.NET developers of all levels of experience.&#160; Most of the workshops and labs will be geared towards the novice.&#160; Some of the discussions will be targeted for experienced practitioners wishing to gain deeper insight.

This will be primarily a .NET/C#-based event, but people who use other platforms and frameworks are welcome to attend and share their insights and hopefully take away some as well.

# What should I bring?

Yourself, of course. Also you may want to bring a laptop with CDROM and/or USB support as we will likely have some digital handouts.&#160; The venue may not have Internet access (I’m checking on this to be sure), so please do not plan on that.

# Who will be presenting and Assisting?

Most of the Austin/San Antonio Los Techies Crew and a few others.&#160; Namely (subject to change): Jimmy Bogard, Eric Hexter, Ray Houston, Joe Ocampo, Jason Meridth, Jeremy Miller, Chad Myers, John Teague, Gregory Long, and others. 

# Why?&#160; 

Because we feel that TDD and related practices have brought a lot of value to our software products and to our employers. We feel that we should try to share this success with the community as a whole in an effort to advance the state of the art and increase the quality of software products in general.
